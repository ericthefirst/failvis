Plan

Minimal Viable Product
	Show overview of all stars of a given class, next to view of misclassified
	Maybe stack views vertically

Data
	Python script to read standard results files and output format specified by Gautham
		each star has u-g, g-r, r-i, i-z, PCA1, PCA2, PCA3 coordinates
	Some method to calculate PCA for entire dataset?
	On launch program, for all datasets
		construct tree of mergeable sketches to store centroids, maybe standard deviations

View 
	Build on small multiples in Processing
	Change between results for different parameters, different techniques
	Change between axes representing various feature pairs and PCA
		with animation
	toggle show individual stars
	animate both changes
		fade 
		or slide between frames frame to another

Control
	click-menu
	cycle through methods using up/down
	cycle through parameters using q/a, w/s, e/d
